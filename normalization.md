## First Normal Form
- Every table listed above has exactly one element per cell (no arrays within a cell).
- Every table above also has a primary key that the non-key columns depend on. And the primary key appears in exactly one row (it is unique).
- Therefore, all the above tables are already in First Normal Form.

## Second Normal Form
- All of the primary keys above are single-column orimary keys (not composite), therefore all non-key columns automatically depend on the whole primary key (since it is already in First Normal Form).
- Therefore, all of the tables above are already in Second Normal Form.

## Third Normal Form
Are there any non-key columns that depend on another non-key column?

### *USER:*
- Everything fully depends on UserID except:
    - Username: Functionally depends on Email, since each email is associated with only one account.
    - Password_Hash: Also depends on Email for the same reason â€” each email is tied to a single password hash.

Analysis:
There is a transitive dependency: Username and Password_Hash depend on Email, which itself depends on the primary key UserID. Since Username and Password_Hash are non-key columns depending on another non-key column (Email), the table is not in Third Normal Form.

Solution:
To bring the table into 3NF, the transitive dependency must be removed. Email is set as a unique identifier (by adding a UNIQUE constraint), and the dependent columns are separated into a new table:

**USER**:
---
| UserID (PK) | Name | Email (FK, UNIQUE) | Role | CreatedAt | LastLogin |
|-------------|------|--------------------|------|-----------|-----------|
---

**USER_CREDENTIALS**:
---
| Email (PK) | Username | Password_Hash |
|------------|----------|----------------|
---

### *LOG_FILE:*
- Everything fully depends on FileID except:
    - FileSize: Functionally depends on RawContent, since the file size is calculated based on the content in the file.

Analysis:
There is a transitive dependency: FileSize depends on RawContent, which itself depends on the primary key FileID. Since FileSize is a non-key columns depending on another non-key column (RawContent), the table is not in Third Normal Form.

Solution:
To bring the table into 3NF, the transitive dependency must be removed. The field FileSize is dropped from the table since it can easily be calculated if needed. New table:
- **LOG_FILE**:
    - FileID (PK)
    - UploadedBy (FK to USER)
    - SourceName
    - SourceType
    - Filename
    - UploadTime

    - RawContent
